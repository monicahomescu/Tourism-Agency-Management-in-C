# Tourism-Agency-Management-in-Cpp

The employees of *“Happy Holidays”* need an application to manage the offers that the agency has. Each **Offer** has a `type` (one of `seaside, mountain or city break`), a `destination`, a `departure date` and a `price`. The employees need the application to help them in the following ways:\
**(a)** Add, delete and update an offer. An offer is uniquely identified by its destination and departure dates.\
**(b)** Display all tourism offers whose destinations contain a given string (if the string is empty, all destinations are considered), and show them sorted ascending by price.\
**(c)** Display all offers of a given type, having their departure after a given date.\
**(d)** Provide multiple undo and redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user.
